# Intermediate Projects

## Overview
This repository contains intermediate-level programming projects and demonstrations that showcase fundamental data structures, algorithms, and software development concepts. These projects bridge the gap between basic syntax understanding and advanced application development.

## Project Categories

### 1. Student Management System
A comprehensive application demonstrating CRUD operations, data persistence, and user interface design. Features include:
- Add, update, delete, and search student records
- Grade tracking and GPA calculation
- File-based data storage
- Input validation and error handling

### 2. Data Structures (Stack, Queue, Linked List)
Implementations of fundamental data structures with detailed explanations:
- Stack: LIFO operations, push/pop functionality
- Queue: FIFO operations, enqueue/dequeue methods
- Linked List: Dynamic memory allocation, node traversal
- Practical use cases for each structure

### 3. Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Classic algorithm implementations with performance analysis:
- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
- Time and space complexity comparisons
- Visual demonstrations of algorithm behavior

### 4. File Reader/Writer
File I/O operations demonstrating:
- Reading and writing text files
- CSV and JSON file handling
- Error handling and exception management
- Batch file processing

### 5. Quiz Application
Interactive console/GUI application featuring:
- Multiple-choice question system
- Score tracking and result analysis
- Question bank management
- Timer functionality
- User feedback and answer review

### 6. REST API Demo
Basic RESTful API implementation showcasing:
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request/response handling
- Data serialization (JSON)
- API endpoint design
- Error handling and status codes

### 7. Data Structure Library
Custom library implementing common data structures:
- Reusable components
- Well-documented API
- Unit tests for validation
- Performance benchmarks

## Learning Objectives
- Master fundamental data structures and algorithms
- Understand object-oriented programming principles
- Develop clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Practice error handling and input validation
- Learn file I/O and data persistence techniques
- Gain experience with API development
- Improve problem-solving and debugging skills

## Technologies Used
- Python (student_management.py, quiz_app.py, rest_api_demo.py)
- C++ (stack_queue.cpp)
- Java (sorting_searching.java)

## Getting Started
Each project file is self-contained with detailed comments explaining:
- Purpose and functionality
- Algorithm logic
- Implementation details
- Usage examples
- Potential improvements
